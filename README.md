# Here be wild things

I hacked this together, so be careful, ha, ha! Runs in Python3. I just wanted to
show off what I have hacked together so far. Please note that there is a bug in
`python-shogi` (which I have worked around):
https://github.com/gunyarakun/python-shogi/issues/3

So just get a `venv` rolling and `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `python
example.py`, open a web browser to http://localhost:5000/!

Not proud of this code, but it works, it's a lil demo that can be messed with!
Currently haven't even tested connecting multiple clients to same websocket...
